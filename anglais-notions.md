**Pb:** How is the situation for women in India?

### I) India's baby girls's fate

As stated in India's 2011 census and mentionned on a poster entitled "50 million missing", indian girls are being "selectively eliminated" from India's population.
They are being murdered through infanticide, dowry-related murders and other practices.

This gendercide has lead to, according to india's 2011 census, a gender imbalance in the Indian population: there are only 940 girls for 1000 boys.

One of Indian families' main argument as to why they go on to murder their newly-born daughters is because of a well-rooted tradition in India: the bride's family has to pay a dowry to the groom's famility. On the one side, it a consequential financial loss, while on the other side, it is an attractive opportunity.
Furthermore, boys can look after the family's business and name, and care about their parents as they get older.

Couples will even seek to find out their baby's sex, to then proceed to sex-selective abortion. To prevent this, the government had forbidden the use of echography to identify the fetus' sex.

This effect is notably illustrated by the novel entitled "Another girl", in which a woman, Kavita, gives birth to a baby girl. After Jasu, Kavita's husband, found out the truth, she tries to convince him not to get rid of her.

### II) Hope for Indian women

The lowest cast in India, the Dalits, formerly known as "untouchable", live in extreme poverty.
A recent concept, microcredits, has helped them out: by making small loans, Dalit women and many other Indians were able to start small businesses.

However, as said in the document named "is microcredit changing India?", Dalit women still have debt which they cannot pay back. They keep doing microcredits, sometimes for making businesses, but most of the time to suffice their needs.

We will finally be looking at the fate of Vika, nicknamed "Whiskey", who is a hijra - a transsexual woman.
Vika is 26 years old and used to be a man. Her family denies her new identity, and she has to live to lives at once: one as a man, with her family, and one as a woman.

To enter the hijra community, she had to find herself a guru.
Her family also forced her to marry herself with a woman, and she now lives with her.

However, she found a few years ago a guru, who helped her to become a hijra. She rents a room, in which she can swap identities and go out with other hijras.
She has a few advantages by being a hijra: people commonly see them as enlightened members of the society, and they donate them for this reason money.
She can also meet her boyfriend thanks to this rented room.

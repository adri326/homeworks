**Theme:** Women's situation in India

**Pb:** How is the situation for women in India?

### I) India's baby girls's fate

As stated in India's 2011 census and mentionned on a poster entitled "50 million missing", indian girls are being "selectively eliminated" from India's population.
They are being murdered through infanticide, dowry-related murders and other practices.

This gendercide has lead to, according to india's 2011 census, a gender imbalance in the Indian population: there are only 940 girls for 1000 boys.

One of Indian families' main argument as to why they go on to murder their newly-born daughters is because of a well-rooted tradition in India: the bride's family has to pay a dowry to the groom's famility. On the one side, it a consequential financial loss, while on the other side, it is an attractive opportunity.
Furthermore, boys can look after the family's business and name, and care about their parents as they get older.

Couples will even seek to find out their baby's sex, to then proceed to sex-selective abortion. To prevent this, the government had forbidden the use of echography to identify the fetus' sex.

This effect is notably illustrated by the novel entitled "Another girl", in which a woman, Kavita, gives birth to a baby girl. After Jasu, Kavita's husband, found out the truth, she tries to convince him not to get rid of her.

### II) Hope for Indian women

The lowest cast in India, the Dalits, formerly known as "untouchable", live in extreme poverty.
A recent concept, microcredits, has helped them out: by making small loans, Dalit women and many other Indians were able to start small businesses.

However, as said in the document named "is microcredit changing India?", Dalit women still have debt which they cannot pay back. They keep doing microcredits, sometimes for making businesses, but most of the time to suffice their needs.

We will finally be looking at the fate of Vika, nicknamed "Whiskey", who is a hijra - a transgender woman.
Vika is 26 years old and used to be a man. Her family denies her new identity, and she has to live to lives at once: one as a man, with her family, and one as a woman.

To enter the hijra community, she had to find herself a guru.
Her family also forced her to marry herself with a woman, and she now lives with her.

However, she found a few years ago a guru, who helped her to become a hijra. She rents a room, in which she can swap identities and go out with other hijras.
She has a few advantages by being a hijra: people commonly see them as enlightened members of the society, and they donate them for this reason money.
She can also meet her boyfriend thanks to this rented room.

Lastly, there has been a recent hashtag on social medias circulating, "#metoo", which has the purpose of denouncing violences and rape on women.
This hashtag has become widespread in India, which has helped the country to stand up against these crimes.

**Theme:** The globalisation of football and its economic issue.

**Problématique:**

### I) The globalisation of football

Football has indeed changed over the last decade, and it has grown globalised.
As Europe grew up after the second world war, football clubs of each country could influence each other. Soon, a pan-european style showed up, which led european countries to have a very strong advantage against other countries.

From about 1980, however, the globalisation of football escalated: during this period, dictatorships ended, cable TV and internet started spreading and travailling became cheaper.
This gave a kick to football, which got wide attention, even by countries formerly not interested in it.

Nowadays, countries which used to be excluded like the United States, Australia and Japan are hoping to win one of the next World Cups.

We will now be looking at the exportation of Manchester United using the picture of a "Manchester United café bar".
It is a place where people can watch football games while having a drink. It is also a store, selling shirt, tickets for games, whistles, scarves and other memorabilia.
This store, however, is located in India, a state in which cricket is more popular than football.

The presence of this store shows the tedency of football clubs to export themselves in other countries. They are becoming common sight around the world.
This way, international foot clubs can grow in popularity elsewhere in the world, which will also contribute to their home nation.

### II) The economic issue of football

At the same time that football grew globalised, football became an entire industry.

Football clubs need money to buy equipment such as clothing, shoes, and balls, but also need to rent playfields and need to pay fees to participate to different cups.
This money has to come from somewhere, and this somewhere are the fans, be it directly or not.

Football companies actively look for sponsors, which will fund them to have their logo printed out on the player's clothing.
This way, bigger, third-party companies, can get a broad audience to which they will show themselves.
Football watchers will then see the company's logo and uncounsciously associate it with the match they just saw, helping them to get a better opinion on these specific companies.
Well-known football like Manchester United clubs are for these companies very attractive, because of their worldwide audience. This can be seen by the amount of logos spread on their player's clothes.

Another way for football clubs to make money is to participate to advertisement campains.
Companies will indeed seek for these opportunities, because it will make their ads much more effective:
football fans will be more interested in the promoted product if there is in its promotion video shots of their favorite players.

They might also have the illusion of performing like their heroes when using promoted gear in such ads.
This is illustrated by the advertisement for *Nike*, featuring famous players like *Neymar* and *Ronaldo*.
In this video, young football players become their favorite players, implicitely thanks to the equipment branded by Nike.

Finally, TV coverage of big football championship like the FIFA league is governed by a single company, FIFA, who decides who will stream the matches and to what costs.
For instance, all of the 64 matches from 2018's league were streamed in France by BeIn sports.
Some of these matches were also streamed by TF1, who bought the rights to BeIn sports.
Nonetheless, FIFA has the monopole over this part of the football industry, and profits greatly from it.

**To sum up, football has globalised itself over the last decades, but has also become an entire industry.**

## Myths and heroes + The notion of Progress

**Theme:** Racial issues in the US

**Problématique:** How was <..> a great figure of the fight against segregation in the US?

### I) A period of segregation

<!-- Looking at the median family wealth by ethnicity between 1963 and 2016, we can see that there is a clear, marked gap between white and black or hispanic families. -->

After the end of the Civil War in 1865, slavery was abolished. However, segregation kept going on.

For instance, the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in 1866, had the objective to terrorize blacks and their supporters.
They did this through elaborate disguises, rituals, whippings and lynchings.

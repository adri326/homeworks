          <p class="left-align light">
            In the last past years, football is more and more globalized. Mainly because the popularity and passion of the football surrounds billions of people from all around the world. Football has a big place in the history of humanity. Nowadays football is a gigantic empire.
            The question is does the globalization of football encourage people for the consumption?

          <h4>Sponsors</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            &emsp;Football games are very often sponsored. Football clubs need money to buy equipments: clothes, football shoes, balls and to maintain Stadiums. The money must come from somewhere and the tickets aren't enough.
            So they ask big companies to be their sponsors: it allows the football clubs to get the equipments, the counterpart is the sponsors are displayed on the Stadium and on the player's clothes. It's an advertisment for the company behind the sponsor.
            Spectators will then see the sponsor's logo while watching football and will associate the pictures of the match to the companies and their products, be it consciously or inconsciously. After the match, the spectators will have a better opinion about these sponsors and will more likely buy a product from them.
            Sponsor companies make more money and football clubs benefit from this. Everyone wins, except the spectator.
            <!-- Hello, code reader! This subject is very broad and I won't be covering the different arguments to why the spectator loses at this game here. But if you're interested, you can head to my website www.shadamethyst.tk, and find me there! -->
          </p>
        </div>

          <h4>Advertisments</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            &emsp;But sponsors are not the only place where big companies can use football to advertise themselves. They can do football related advertisments!
            As football is very popular, people who see the advertisments will have a better opinion about the product and will think it's better than another same product from another company.
            They use the image, the popularity of football players to highlight the fact that they can be trusted for their product: if a popular football player use that product then the product should be high quality.
            In the case of a child as the spectator who watch the advertisment, we can imagine a simple example: the child is fan of a football player, and they sees an advertisment for a backpack but it does not show any football related content,
            after that, there is a second advertisment but for another backpack and it shows some popular football players and there is the favorite player of the child: the child would pick the backpack from the football related advertisment, even if they already has a backpack.
            And it's the same for anyone.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 l6">
              <p class="left-align light">
                For example we can observe that advertisment for <span style="font-style: italic;">Nike</span>.
                We can see that there is many popular football players like <span class="italic">Neymar</span>, <span class="italic">Ronaldo</span>, etc.
                The video starts with a scene of young football players who want to play like their favorite players, then we can see they "become" their favorite players and play as them.
                We can see the <span class="italic">Nike</span> logo everywhere in the video: on the clothes, on the stadium, even on the ball!
                <span class="italic">Nike</span> is very highlighted via the football in this video and as there is popular football players, fans will more likely buy products from <span class="italic">Nike</span> to do the same as their heroes.

          <p class="left-align light">
            &emsp; Another source of incomes for football clubs are merchandise: selling memorabilia, scarves or shoes displaying the team's name and/or logo.
            This allows clubs to gain more visibility on a worldwide scale and to gain their fans's trust.
          </p>
					<p class="left-align light">
						While this sounds nice, this means that football clubs don't compete on a regional scale: their fans aren't simply the ones living in the same town, but are actually from the entire world.
						Concurrency builds up on a global scale and clubs have to compete always harder to gain coverage.

						Big sports events like the World Cup cannot be streamed by everyone. The FIFA company signs contracts with a small selection of TV channels giving them the exclusive right to stream the match.
						2018's 64 matches were all streamed in France by the company BeIn Sports, yet the channel TF1 bought the rights to stream 28 of these matches.
						TV Companies may even buy exclusive, expensive privileges to install their own cameras.
						This shows us that the FIFA Company has the monopole over the World Cup's TV coverage, and thus they make money from the different TV companies.
					</p>
					<p class="align-left light">
						These TV Companies will, on the other hand, have a much bigger audience around these events. Ad spots on their channel may be sold at much higher prices.
						The channel TF1 had over 16 millions viewers during the matches played by the french team in the 2018 World cup, making this season a very productive period for them.
